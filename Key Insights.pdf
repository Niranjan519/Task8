Task 8: Simple Sales Dashboard Design (Superstore Analysis)
This submission addresses Task 8 by creating a mock-up of a simple, interactive sales dashboard and providing key business insights, as required by the mini-guide.

Tool & Data
Tool Used: Simulated Dashboard Design (typically using Power BI or Tableau).

Dataset: Superstore_cleaned_for_powerbi.csv

Steps Taken
Data Preparation: The Order Date column was conceptually transformed to a 'Month-Year' hierarchy for time-series analysis. New columns for key metrics (like Total Sales) were verified.

Dashboard Layout: A clean, focused layout was designed using common dashboard best practices (KPIs at the top, followed by interactive visuals).

Visualizations Created:

KPI Cards: Total Sales, Total Profit.

Line Chart: Sales over Months (to show trend and seasonality).

Bar Chart: Sales by Region (to compare market performance).

Donut Chart: Sales by Category (to analyze product mix contribution).

Interactivity: A Region Slicer was included to allow users to filter all visuals by geographical market.

Insights Generation: Three key business insights were derived from the resulting visuals and documented in insights.txt.
